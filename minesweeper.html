	 Implement minesweeper

	 variables used:
		docobj -- const document object 
		num_rows_k, num_cols_k -- number of rows and columns (10 each)
		init_num_bombs_k -- number of bombs to start (not specified in problem statement)
		state_* -- pseudo-enum containing all of the states a cell can have
		images -- array using state_* as index giving the path to the images for each state
		cells -- a matrix (num_rows_k by num_cols_k) giving hte img objects.
		did_init_bomb -- I won't generate the bomb until after the user makes his first click
			since there's nothing as irritating a hitting a bomb immediately.
		has_bombs -- boolean matrix if a cell has a bomb or not.
		cur_states, new_states -- matrix of current and new state values for each cell.
			The plan is cur_states will be the values as seen by the user and the 
			left and right click functions will update the new_states matrix.  The display
			function will change the cells matrix as needed and update cur_states to new_states.
